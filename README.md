# Statistics-Calculator
I took statistics over the summer and was told to buy an expensive calculator. I didn't feel like buying an expensive calculator when I can code something just as effective (and easier for me to use) myself. After getting approval from the teacher, I made this master file that covers all of the functions we used in class. As it was for my personal use and I didn't have much need to revisit, I didn't bother with making it super readable. However, it worked for my purposes perfectly and I did very well in the class with the fun project I created for myself.
